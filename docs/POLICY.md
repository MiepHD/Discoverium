# Policy for admission to, rejection from, and removal from the repository

1. Functionality & Usefulness

   The app should have a meaningful use case, not just a “Hello World”.

   Basic level of usability—doesn’t have to be pretty, but shouldn’t be broken.

2. Malware-Free

   Apps must not contain malicious code, spyware, or abusive behavior (e.g., data harvesting, location tracking without consent).
