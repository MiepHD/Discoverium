### Admission policy

## How it works

See [How it works](docs/HOWITWORKS.md).

## Fork

Discoverium is a fork of [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium). [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) is great, but it is missing one feature. That feature is a search function for application discovery, like a repository or store. As far as can be told the lack of the feature is very intentional.

## Limitations

- For some sources, data is gathered using Web scraping and can easily break due to changes in website design. In such cases, more reliable methods may be unavailable.
